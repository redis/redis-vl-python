      "\n",
      "**Ingredients:**\n",
      "\n",
      "- 2 cups (250 grams) all-purpose flour\n",
      "- 2 teaspoons baking powder\n",
      "- 1 teaspoon salt\n",
      "- 2 tablespoons sugar\n",
      "- 2 cups milk\n",
      "- 2 eggs\n",
      "- 3 tablespoons melted butter, plus more for the pan\n",
      "- 1 teaspoon vanilla extract (optional)\n",
      "\n",
      "**Instructions:**\n",
      "\n",
      "1. Whisk together the dry ingredients: In a large mixing bowl, combine the flour, baking powder, salt, and sugar. Whisk until well blended.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. Combine the wet ingredients: In a separate mixing bowl, whisk together the milk, eggs, melted butter, and vanilla extract (if using). Make sure the melted butter has cooled down a bit so it doesn't cook the eggs.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. Mix dry and wet ingredients: Slowly pour the wet ingredients into the dry ingredients while continuously whisking until you have a smooth batter. Be careful not to overmix; a few small lumps are okay.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. Heat your griddle or pan: Place a nonstick pan or griddle over medium heat and add a small amount of butter to grease the surface. Let the butter melt and coat the cooking surface.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. Pour the batter: Once the pan is hot, pour about 1/4 cup of batter for each pancake onto the griddle or pan. Cook until the edges look dry and small bubbles appear on the surface, about 2-3 minutes.\n",
      "\n",
      "6. Flip the pancakes: Use a spatula to carefully flip the pancakes. Cook the other side for another 1-2 minutes until lightly browned.\n",
      "\n",
      "7. Repeat: Repeat this process until you've cooked all your batter, adding more butter to the pan as needed.\n",
      "\n",
      "8. Serve: Stack the pancakes on a plate and serve them with your favorite toppings. Some popular options include butter, maple syrup, fresh fruit, whipped cream, or a dusting of powdered sugar.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Variations and Tips:**\n",
      "- For extra fluffy pancakes, you can separate the eggs and gently fold in the whipped egg whites after combining the other ingredients.\n",
      "- Feel free to add mix-ins to your batter, such as chocolate chips, blueberries, or chopped nuts.\n",
      "- If you like thicker pancakes, you can add a little less milk to the batter. For thinner pancakes, add a bit more.\n",
      "- To keep pancakes warm while you cook a large batch, preheat your oven to its lowest setting and place the cooked pancakes on a baking sheet or oven-safe plate.\n",

      "LLM:  Certainly! For a vegan version of fluffy pancakes, you can replace both the eggs and butter with plant-based alternatives. Here's the recipe tailored for vegan dietary preferences:\n",
      "\n",
      "**Ingredients:**\n",
      "\n",
      "- 2 cups (250 grams) all-purpose flour\n",
      "- 2 teaspoons baking powder\n",
      "- 1 teaspoon salt\n",
      "- 2 tablespoons sugar\n",
      "- 2 cups plant-based milk (such as soy, almond, or oat milk)\n",
      "- 2 tablespoons neutral-flavored oil (such as canola or vegetable oil), plus more for the pan\n",
      "- 1 teaspoon vanilla extract (optional)\n",
      "\n",
      "**Instructions:**\n",
      "\n",
      "1. Whisk together the dry ingredients: In a large mixing bowl, combine the flour, baking powder, salt, and sugar. Mix well to ensure there are no lumps.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. Combine the wet ingredients: In a separate mixing bowl, whisk together the plant-based milk, oil, and vanilla extract (if using).\n",
      "\n",
      "3. Mix dry and wet ingredients: Slowly pour the wet ingredients into the dry ingredients, whisking continuously until you have a smooth batter. It's okay if there are a few small lumps.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. Heat your griddle or pan: Place a nonstick pan or griddle over medium heat. Add a small amount of oil to grease the surface, ensuring it coats the cooking area evenly.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. Pour the batter: Once the pan is hot, pour about 1/4 cup of batter for each pancake onto the griddle or pan. Cook until you notice small bubbles appearing on the surface and the edges look dry, which should take about 2-3 minutes.\n",
      "\n",
      "6. Flip the pancakes: Use a spatula to carefully flip the pancakes. Cook the other side for an additional 1-2 minutes until lightly browned.\n",
      "\n",
      "7. Repeat: Repeat this process until you've cooked all your batter, adding more oil to the pan as needed to prevent sticking.\n",
      "\n",
      "8. Serve: Stack the pancakes on a plate and serve them with your favorite vegan toppings. Some options include maple syrup, vegan butter, fresh fruit, or a dustable amount of powdered sugar.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Tips for Vegan Pancakes:**\n",
      "- The oil replaces the butter in this recipe, providing moisture and helping to create a crispy edge on the pancakes.\n",
      "- Feel free to experiment with different plant-based milk alternatives to find your preferred taste and texture. Soy milk tends to be creamier, while almond or oat milk can lend a subtle nutty flavor.\n",
      "- If you like your pancakes with a hint of sweetness, you can add a bit more sugar to the batter or top them with sweet vegan toppings like agave nectar or fruit compote.\n",
