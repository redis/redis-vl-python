## Tutorial Structure

Each tutorial follows this structure:

1. **Introduction**: What you'll build and why it matters
2. **Prerequisites**: What you need to know before starting
3. **Setup**: Installing dependencies and preparing your environment
4. **Step-by-Step Instructions**: Guided implementation with explanations
5. **Testing**: Verifying your implementation works
6. **Next Steps**: Where to go from here

## Learning Path

We recommend completing tutorials in this order:

```
1. Getting Started (if you haven't already)
   ↓
2. Semantic Caching
   ↓
3. Message History
   ↓
4. Semantic Router
```

## Tips for Success

- **Follow along**: Type the code yourself rather than copy-pasting
- **Experiment**: Try modifying the examples to deepen understanding
- **Take breaks**: Complex topics are easier to absorb in chunks
- **Ask questions**: Use GitHub Discussions if you get stuck

## After Completing Tutorials

Once you've completed these tutorials, you're ready to:

- **Explore How-To Guides**: Learn specific techniques for common tasks
- **Review Use Cases**: See complete application examples
- **Build Your Own**: Apply what you've learned to your projects
