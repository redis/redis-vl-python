    "# Rerank Search Results\n",
    "\n",
    "This guide demonstrates how to use RedisVL to rerank search results (documents, chunks, or records) based on query relevance. RedisVL supports reranking through Cross-Encoders from [Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co/cross-encoder), [Cohere Rerank API](https://docs.cohere.com/docs/rerank-2), and [VoyageAI Rerank API](https://docs.voyageai.com/docs/reranker).\n",
    "\n",
    "## Prerequisites\n",
    "\n",
    "Before you begin, ensure you have:\n",
    "- Installed RedisVL: `pip install redisvl`\n",
    "- A running Redis instance ([Redis 8+](https://redis.io/downloads/) or [Redis Cloud](https://redis.io/cloud))\n",
    "\n",
    "## What You'll Learn\n",
    "\n",
    "By the end of this guide, you will be able to:\n",
    "- Rerank search results using HuggingFace Cross-Encoders\n",
    "- Use the Cohere Rerank API with search results\n",
    "- Use the VoyageAI Rerank API for result reranking\n",
    "- Control the number of returned results after reranking"
