    "- A re-ranker that uses pre-trained [Cross-Encoders](https://sbert.net/examples/applications/cross-encoder/README.html) which can use models from [Hugging Face cross encoder models](https://huggingface.co/cross-encoder) or Hugging Face models that implement a cross encoder function ([example: BAAI/bge-reranker-base](https://huggingface.co/BAAI/bge-reranker-base)).\n",
    "- The [Cohere /rerank API](https://docs.cohere.com/docs/rerank-2).\n",
    "\n",
    "Before running this notebook, be sure to:\n",
    "1. Have installed ``redisvl`` and have that environment active for this notebook.\n",
    "2. Have a running Redis Stack instance with RediSearch > 2.4 active.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, you can run Redis Stack locally with Docker:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "docker run -d -p 6379:6379 -p 8001:8001 redis/redis-stack:latest\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This will run Redis on port 6379 and RedisInsight at http://localhost:8001."
