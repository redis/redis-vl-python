You can scramble, fry, poach, or boil eggs, or make an omelet or frittata with your favorite vegetables, meats, and cheeses.\\n- Pancakes or waffles: Treat yourself to a stack of fluffy pancakes or waffles for breakfast. You can top them with butter and syrup, or get creative with fruit, whipped cream, chocolate chips, or nut butter.\\n\\nThese are just a few ideas, but the possibilities for breakfast are endless! Feel free to experiment and find what you like best. Bon appetit!'}\n"
