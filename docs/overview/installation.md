# Install RedisVL

There are a few ways to install RedisVL. The easiest way is to use pip.

## Install RedisVL with Pip

Install `redisvl` into your Python (>=3.8) environment using `pip`:

```bash
$ pip install -U redisvl
```

RedisVL comes with a few dependencies that are automatically installed, however, a few dependencies
are optional and can be installed separately if needed:

```bash
$ pip install redisvl[all]  # install vectorizer dependencies
$ pip install redisvl[dev]  # install dev dependencies
```

If you use ZSH, remember to escape the brackets:

```bash
$ pip install redisvl\[all\]
```

This library supports the use of hiredis, so you can also install by running:

```bash
pip install redisvl[hiredis]
```

## Install RedisVL from Source

To install RedisVL from source, clone the repository and install the package using `pip`:

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/redis/redis-vl-python.git && cd redisvl
$ pip install .

# or for an editable installation (for developers of RedisVL)
$ pip install -e .
```


## Installing Redis

RedisVL requires a distribution of Redis that supports the [Search and Query](https://redis.com/modules/redis-search/) capability of which there are 3:

offering
1. [Redis Cloud](https://redis.io/cloud), a fully managed cloud offering
2. [Redis Stack](https://redis.io/docs/getting-started/install-stack/docker/), a local docker image for testing and development
3. [Redis Enterprise](https://redis.com/redis-enterprise/), a commercial self-hosted



### Redis Cloud

Redis Cloud is the easiest way to get started with RedisVL. You can sign up for a free account [here](https://redis.io/cloud). Make sure to have the `Search and Query`
capability enabled when creating your database.


### Redis Stack (local development)

For local development and testing, Redis-Stack can be used. We recommend running Redis
in a docker container. To do so, run the following command:

```bash
docker run -d --name redis-stack -p 6379:6379 -p 8001:8001 redis/redis-stack:latest
```

This will also spin up the [Redis Insight GUI](https://redis.io/insight/) at `http://localhost:8001`.


### Redis Enterprise (self-hosted)

Redis Enterprise is a commercial offering that can be self-hosted. You can download the latest version [here](https://redis.io/downloads/).

If you are considering a self-hosted Redis Enterprise deployment on Kubernetes, there is the [Redis Enterprise Operator](https://docs.redis.com/latest/kubernetes/) for Kubernetes. This will allow you to easily deploy and manage a Redis Enterprise cluster on Kubernetes.
